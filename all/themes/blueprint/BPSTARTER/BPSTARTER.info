  ; This section adds CSS files to your theme. The media type is specified in

  ;
  ; You can also override any of Blueprint's stylesheets or any module's stylesheets,

  ; To prevent stylesheets of a base theme or of a module from being included in
  ; our sub-theme, we specify it in our .info file (and we don't need to have a
  ; stylesheet in our sub-theme with that name.) For example, we prevent the
  ; blueprint.css file in the base theme from being included by specifying it here.

  ; These regions defined in Blueprint's default page.tpl.php file.  The name in
  ; brackets is the name of the variable in the page.tpl.php file, (e.g.
  ; "[left]" in the .info file means there should be a $left
  ; variable in the page.tpl.php file.) The text after the equals sign is a
  ; descriptive text used on the admin/build/blocks page.
  ;
  ; To add a new region, copy Blueprint's page.tpl.php to your sub-theme's directory,
  ; add a line to this file, and then add the new variable to your
  ; page.tpl.php template.

  ; Various page elements output by the theme can be toggled on and off. The
