## Instructions

* Get the COD files
* Setup the database using `db/dcm.sql`
* After setting up a working copy of drupal, set "Drupal Camp Mumbai" as your theme from `/admin/build/themes`
* Enable features and `drupal_camp_mumbai_settings` module using `drush en drupal_camp_mumbai_settings` command from your terminal

Well, I guess that should set you up! You probably have to do minor changes here and there...

## Todo's
* Remove "welcome note" using the proper way i.e, from `template.php` (currently its hidden by css - display:none)
